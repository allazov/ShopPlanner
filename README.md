# Shopping Recommendation System

Hello there! üëã 

Welcome to the shopping recommendation system. This is a simple Python program that aids in your shopping experience by recommending products based on your budget and preferences. This tool is handy when you are still deciding what to buy or overwhelmed by the numerous options in online stores.

## How Does It Work?

This program first asks you to input your budget for the shopping. Next, it inquires about the items you are interested in purchasing and the quantity for each item. It also considers your shopping strategy, be it 'economical' or 'premium'.

Based on your input, the program provides recommendations from a pre-defined list of products. The offers are made according to your stated budget, the number of each item you wish to purchase, and your shopping strategy. 

If you lean towards the 'economical' strategy, the system will recommend the cheapest options, while a 'premium' strategy will yield the most expensive options.

However, the fun continues! If your budget isn't sufficient for the items you wish to purchase, the program alerts you and provides the extra funding needed. You can then decide to increase your budget or skip the item. 

Lastly, it provides you with a summary of recommended products, the total cost, and the remaining budget.

## Why Was This Written?

This project aims to make online shopping more accessible and more efficient for users. Offering personalized recommendations helps shoppers make better decisions and avoid the often overwhelming abundance of choices.
