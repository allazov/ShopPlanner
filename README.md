# Shopping Recommendation System

Hello there! üëã 

Welcome to the shopping recommendation system. This is a simple Python program that aids in your shopping experience by recommending products based on your budget and preferences. This tool is particularly useful when you are uncertain about what to buy or overwhelmed by the numerous options in online stores.

## How Does It Work?

This program first asks you to input your budget for the shopping. Next, it inquires about the items you are interested in purchasing and the quantity for each item. It also considers your shopping strategy, be it 'economical' or 'premium'.

Based on your inputs, the program then provides recommendations from a pre-defined list of products. The recommendations are made according to your stated budget, the number of each item you wish to purchase, and your shopping strategy. 

If you lean towards the 'economical' strategy, the system will recommend the cheapest options, while a 'premium' strategy will yield the most expensive options.

However, the fun doesn't stop there! If your budget isn't sufficient for the items you wish to purchase, the program alerts you and provides the extra budget needed. You can then decide to increase your budget or skip the item. 

Lastly, it provides you with a summary of recommended products, the total cost, and the remaining budget.

## Why Was This Written?

This project aims to make online shopping easier and more efficient for users. By offering personalized recommendations, it helps shoppers make better decisions and avoid the often overwhelming abundance of choices.

With an easy-to-use interactive system, you don't need any technical knowledge to use it. So go ahead, try it out, and happy shopping! üõçÔ∏è

## How to Use This?

It's quite simple to use this system. Just run the Python script and follow the prompts. Enter your budget, the items you wish to purchase (along with their quantities), and your preferred shopping strategy. Sit back and let the program guide you through a better shopping experience.
